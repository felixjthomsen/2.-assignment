This is a RMD-file (An R-MarkDown file) that you can use for your report and exercises. 

## 1. Opening

You should start by opening the Rmd-file in RStudio. If you then click the *Knit* button, you will get the HTML result shown in the Viewer pane in RStudio. 

```{r init, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(markdown)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readxl)
theme_set(theme_bw())
X <- "x"
```


### Remove messages

You can modify your code block easily.

* You can remove all the messages in the top by writing `, message=FALSE` after `init`. Try it out.
* You can hide the code block by writing `, echo=FALSE` after `init`. Try it out. 
* You can exclude everything using  `include = FALSE`
* You can remove warnings using `warning = FALSE`


Try it out on this first. You can check the knittet output.

## 2. Variables - make your first code

Try to create a variable. Assign the number 4. Update the variable with a mathematical operator such that results ends being 8.

```{r}
# here, assign 4 to a variable. 

# here, use a math operator (*+-/) such that the results will be 8 
# (you are free to do it in anyway you like - but the result should be 8)


```




### Running code - and do your first debug


Be sure you have evaluated (run) the very first code chunk in this document called `init`. 

If you want to run the code below as you are knitting, remove the chunk option `eval=FALSE` from the chunk below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# I wrote this code for you
x <- "R-code"

X

```


You can even include the content of `X` in your document text by using \` r code \` around the code part to get: `r X`.

But why does it not work? it should spit out "R-code"?


### Data types

Recall from the slides that we can check data types.
What is the datatypes of `x`? 

```{r}
# What is the datatype of x?


# What is the datatype of x1 in the following?
x1 <- "hello number 1"

# What is the datatype of y?
y <- 3

```


### Logic operators


```{r}
# check if x and x1 are equal

# check if y is smaller than y1:
y1 <- 6


```




## 3. You should read in two files

The data for this exercise is in the file `who_disease.csv` in Canvas. You should download it to your own course folder before reading it into R. It is easiest, if you have it in the same folder as the r-code

* Start by importing this data set using the RStudio data import widget. You can either do this via the *Import Dataset* button that you find in the Environment pane, or from the file menu. 
Either way, this file is a CSV file (text). 
* Before importing the data, check if the columns-types are meaningful.
* Copy the code before clicking on *Import*. 

Once you have imported your data set, it appears in your Global Environment (the Environment pane) 
as *who_disease*. If you click on the small table icon to the far right of the name of the data set, 
you get a preview of the data. 

* Now paste the code that you copied before into the empty code chunk below for reading in the data. Delete the line `View(who_disease)` from the pasted code.

* Do the same for `BagsOfOranges.xlsx`. Notice, that this is an excel-file! 

```{r reading_data, cache=TRUE}

## This is an empty code chunk. Fill in the loading code here

  
```


### Insert code chunck and look at files

* Try to insert a code chunk here and look at one of the files from Ex 2 using the command `head(dataframe_name)`. 
* You can also use `str()` and `summary()`. What do they show?

You will use the files in next exercise class.



## 4. (IF TIME ALLOWS) Customization of the knitr document

In this exercise, you should modify the existing chunks and chunk options to customize the results.  

* Clean your R Markdown document: 
** Check the organization of chunks and give them names. 
** Change the setting on code folding so that code is not shown by default. 
*** Get help from google or cheat sheets or copilot

### Tutorials and interactive resources

If you have more time, try out:

* The `swirl` package. See also the script `Rtutorial_swirl.r`. Swirl is a tutorial build into the R-interface.
* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) has some nice tutorials your can try out. I am trying to get you a student license for the course.
